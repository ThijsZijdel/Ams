# Amsta
HvA Project PAD - AMS5 - Group 5

Web Application for the company Amsta Amsterdam.




## Getting Started
```typescript
    interface GreetingTeam {
      greeting: string;
      name: string;
      studentNmr?: number;
    }
    
    declare function greet(setting: GreetingTeam): void;
```

### Development
Before developing the application you'll need some things installed.

The easiest way of installing the needed libaries, compilers etc etc is by node.js package manager. Download link:
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 

>(Link to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)) for documentation


Than you will need to install [Angular Cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
 > See the readme for install process 
 
 > Note: it IS NOT needed to create a new Project !

After you have installed angular Cli you're almost done.

Get this repository to your local drive (preferred with git access)

And type the following command:

```text
  cd ROUTE_TO_YOUR/Amsta
  ng serve --open
```

Now the application is running and you can start developing.




### Usage
Currently the application isn't public available.
